CBC:
===
MCV, MCH, MCHC - Normocytic, Normochromic, Nonregenerative
"FORGET MCH" -Dr. Meuten
MCV (60-77 fl)- Measured directly. HCT = MCV x RBC. In vitro hemolysis, decr RBC, decr Hct.
MCHC = HGB/PCV (accurate) or HGB/HCT = 1/3 (HGB x3 = ideal PCV). Incr MCHC = In vitro hemolysis, red flag (see above).
    Decr MCHC: Heinz bodies, Red maple
Cheap machines only measure MCV and RBC (and HGB?) and calculate Hct (MCV x RBC), MCHC (HGB/Hct), etc.

Pyknocytosis:
============
Acanthocytes =spur cells, thorn cells
Schistocytes = frags
Echinocytes
